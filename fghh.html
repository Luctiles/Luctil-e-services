HTML5 LAYOUT 434
The <nav> element is used to 
contain the major navigational 
blocks on the site such as the 
primary site navigation.
Going back to our blog example, 
if you wanted to finish an article 
with links to related blog posts, 
these would not be counted as 
major navigational blocks and 
therefore should not sit inside a 
<nav> element.
At the time of writing, some of 
the developers that were already 
using HTML5 decided to use the 
<nav> element for the links that 
appear at the bottom of every 
page (links to things like privacy 
policy, terms and conditions 
and accessibility information). 
Whether this will be widely 
adopted is still yet to be seen.
